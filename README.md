## Introduction
[Provide an introduction to the notebook, including its objectives and any relevant background information.]

## Data Loading
[Explain how data is loaded into the notebook, including any libraries used and the source of the data.]

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Handle missing values
data = data.fillna(method='ffill')

# Encode categorical variables
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['category'])

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{conf_matrix}')
